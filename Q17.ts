//17. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

//• Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying 
//that you can invite only two people for dinner.

//• Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. 
//Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them 
//know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

//• Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.

//• Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to 
//make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
